**Project name:** Sierra's Virtual Bookshelf

**Goals:** To create an interactive virtual bookshelf to further my coding skills. 

**Context:** I have seen people make tiny replicas of their bookshelves using wood blocks and paper. 
I thought, "Why not make a virtual version?" This would allow me to envision ways that I can rearrange my physical bookshelf if I want, without going through the actual hassle just to decide that I do not like how it looks. I would also like to be able to view more information on the books featured such as Title, Author, Genre, and Personal Rating.

**Novelty:** I have seen websites like GoodReads and StoryGraph used to show off books people have read before. While they do allow the user to visually view what books they have already read, they don't allow the user to rearrange how the books are displayed like a real bookshelf.

**Functionality:** A way to be able to click and drag to move books with the mouse. I would also like to be able to turn the book to change its orientation. 

**Audience:** People who love to read and show others what they are reading!

**Challenges:** Getting the interactivity right seems like it would be difficult. 

**Measures:** Is the book displayed? Can the book be moved around the screen? Is it functional in the way I would like it to be?

**Motivation:** Of course, I want to work on a project that takes my hobbies into account. The one thing I love to do is to read. I have not been very confident in CS as a major, and I don't know if/how there is a way to incorporate my love of reading with that, but I think this Capstone project could help.  

**Future extensions:** It would be nice to incorporate a way to include my book reviews along with the other book demographics.
