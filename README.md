# *Sierra's Virtual Bookshelf*
## Description/Motivation

I love to read and keep track of my favorite books. Unfortunately, I cannot bring my bookshelf everywhere I go... or can I? I hope to design a virtual representation of a bookshelf that I can modify by arranging and rearranging books in any way that I desire.
